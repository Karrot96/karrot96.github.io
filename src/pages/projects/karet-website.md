# 🚀 Karet Website Project

This page documents the development of **karet.co.uk**, a static site built with **Astro**, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and using **Google Cloud DNS**.

## 📌 Why This Website?

I wanted a place to store **useful technical information** I’ve built up over my career—creating a **single repository** for easy reference.

- This site is **separate from work** and contains **no confidential information**.
- My **old portfolio website was outdated**, so replacing it with something **more practical** made sense.
- **AI plays a key role** in this build. I want to explore **how AI can assist**, what works well, and where it falls short.

I will document my experiences with **AI in web development** as I go.

🔗 **Meta Entries** track **key decisions and changes** along the way.

## 🤖 AI in This Project

I'm using **ChatGPT** as an assistant in multiple ways:

- **Technology Decisions** → Helping evaluate frameworks, hosting, and architecture.
- **Content Management** → Structuring knowledge storage and workflow.
- **Implementation** → Assisting with code, debugging, and optimization.

### 🔀 Multi-Chat Workflow

I've found that using **separate ChatGPT chats for different topics** helps keep discussions focused.

✅ **Pros:**

- Easier to manage different aspects in parallel.
- Helps maintain a structured approach.

❌ **Cons:**

- Syncing knowledge across chats is difficult.
- Attempting to transfer information between chats only worked once.

I'll continue exploring how AI can best assist in a **real-world project** and document what works and what doesn’t.

## 📌 Initial Setup

To get started quickly, we did a **minimal Astro install**, focusing on reaching an **MVP** where we could begin documenting as we built.

### 🔹 Key Steps Taken:

- Installed **Astro** with the basic template.
- Set up **GitHub** to enable pages as the planned hosting solution and allow chatgpt to view the work as we went.
- Created a **`/projects/karet-website.md`** page to document development.
- Established a **Meta section** (`/meta/`) for changelogs with commentary.
- Implemented **standardized frontmatter** for consistency.

This approach allowed us to **start small, iterate quickly, and document our decisions in real time**.

## 🎨 Improving the Look & Feel

After getting the **basic structure and documentation in place**, the next step is to **improve the visual design** of the website.

### 🔹 Goals:

- Make the site **more visually appealing** while keeping it simple.
- Improve **typography, spacing, and readability**.
- Ensure a **clean layout** that scales well as content grows.

### 🛠 Planned Improvements:

- Introduce a **global layout** with a header, navigation, and footer.
- Add a **CSS framework or custom styles** for better aesthetics.
- Improve **content presentation** to make documentation easier to read.

This will make the site more **usable and professional-looking** while maintaining its lightweight, fast-loading nature.

Note, the above was generated by chatgpt as its plan after I asked it to focus on this. Lets now see how it goes about implementing the changes.

### 🚨 Pain Point: Astro's Frontmatter Limitations

We tried using **Vite aliases (`@layouts/`)** in Markdown frontmatter to apply a **global layout**, but Astro **does not support this**.

🔹 **What this means:**

- Every Markdown file must use **relative paths** like:

  ```md
  layout: "../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro"
  ```

- Moving files requires manual path updates.
- There is no built-in way to set a default Markdown layout.

This is a frustrating limitation, but for now, we are sticking with relative paths and tracking Astro updates.

## 🤖 ChatGPT’s Failure to Follow Tailwind Setup

During the Tailwind CSS setup, ChatGPT **repeatedly provided incorrect installation steps**, despite me following the official [Tailwind Astro Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/astro).

### ❌ What Went Wrong

- ChatGPT suggested **manual installation (`npm install tailwindcss`)**, instead of the correct `npx astro add tailwind`.
- Multiple attempts to correct this were ignored, leading to unnecessary troubleshooting.
- ChatGPT provided incorrect **global CSS instructions** (using `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` instead of the correct `@import "tailwindcss";`).

### ✅ What Actually Worked

The correct method was:

```sh
npx astro add tailwind
```

And setting src/styles/global.css to:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

This highlights a clear limitation in AI-assisted development—even when the correct information is available, AI-generated responses can repeatedly be wrong, requiring manual verification against official documentation.
