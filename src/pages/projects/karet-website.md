# 🚀 Karet Website Project

This page documents the development of **karet.co.uk**, a static site built with **Astro**, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and using **Google Cloud DNS**.

## 📌 Why This Website?

I wanted a place to store **useful technical information** I’ve built up over my career—creating a **single repository** for easy reference.

- This site is **separate from work** and contains **no confidential information**.
- My **old portfolio website was outdated**, so replacing it with something **more practical** made sense.
- **AI plays a key role** in this build. I want to explore **how AI can assist**, what works well, and where it falls short.

I will document my experiences with **AI in web development** as I go.

🔗 **Meta Entries** track **key decisions and changes** along the way.

## 🤖 AI in This Project

I'm using **ChatGPT** as an assistant in multiple ways:

- **Technology Decisions** → Helping evaluate frameworks, hosting, and architecture.
- **Content Management** → Structuring knowledge storage and workflow.
- **Implementation** → Assisting with code, debugging, and optimization.

### 🔀 Multi-Chat Workflow

I've found that using **separate ChatGPT chats for different topics** helps keep discussions focused.

✅ **Pros:**

- Easier to manage different aspects in parallel.
- Helps maintain a structured approach.

❌ **Cons:**

- Syncing knowledge across chats is difficult.
- Attempting to transfer information between chats only worked once.

I'll continue exploring how AI can best assist in a **real-world project** and document what works and what doesn’t.

## 📌 Initial Setup

To get started quickly, we did a **minimal Astro install**, focusing on reaching an **MVP** where we could begin documenting as we built.

### 🔹 Key Steps Taken:

- Installed **Astro** with the basic template.
- Set up **GitHub** to enable pages as the planned hosting solution and allow chatgpt to view the work as we went.
- Created a **`/projects/karet-website.md`** page to document development.
- Established a **Meta section** (`/meta/`) for changelogs with commentary.
- Implemented **standardized frontmatter** for consistency.

This approach allowed us to **start small, iterate quickly, and document our decisions in real time**.
