# Why I Chose Astro for karet.co.uk

## 🚀 **Goal of the Website**
I am rebuilding [karet.co.uk](https://karet.co.uk) to be **more than just a portfolio**—a place to share technical thoughts and learnings. The key priorities are:

- **Low Cost** → Hosting must be **free or very cheap**.
- **Static & Fast** → Content should load **instantly**.
- **Markdown-Based** → Writing and publishing should be **simple**.
- **Scalable** → Should **support future interactivity** if needed.

## 🔍 **Evaluating Static Site Generators**
I explored different options before settling on Astro:

| Framework | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Jekyll** | Works with GitHub Pages natively, simple | Ruby-based, slow builds |
| **Hugo** | Super fast, many themes | Strict content structure, harder customization |
| **Eleventy (11ty)** | Flexible, Markdown-friendly | Limited plugins, verbose config |
| **Astro** ✅ | Lightweight, fast, hybrid rendering | Higher initial setup, JS-based |

## 🌟 **Why Astro Won?**
1. **Flexible Rendering** → Astro lets me keep pages **purely static** while allowing **interactive components later**.  
2. **Performance** → Unlike React/Next.js, Astro **only ships the needed JS**.  
3. **Markdown-Friendly** → Creating content is as simple as adding a `.md` file.  
4. **Future-Proof** → If I ever need dynamic features, **I don’t have to migrate** to another framework.  

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- **Framework**: Astro  
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (public repo)  
- **Domain Management**: Google Cloud DNS  
- **CI/CD**: To be revisited later  

## 🔮 **Next Steps**
- ✅ Set up Astro with GitHub Pages  
- ⏳ Add a tagging system for organizing content  
- ⏳ Implement search functionality  

## 🤖 **ChatGPT Assistance**
This document was **generated with the help of ChatGPT**. Specifically, ChatGPT assisted with:
- Structuring the document.
- Summarizing the reasons for choosing Astro.
- Creating the comparison table.

I plan to tag all **ChatGPT-assisted content** clearly so that it's transparent where AI was used in my work.
